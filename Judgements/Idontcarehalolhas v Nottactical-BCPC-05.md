**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This matter concerns a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, Idontcarehalolha, against the Defendant, Nottactical, Improper Agency Action and Procedural Misconduct.

[2] On January 18, 2026, the Plaintiff was taken into custody by the Defendant following an arrest. While restrained, the Plaintiff was transported to an RCMP detachment holding cell and left unattended for an extended period without proper supervision or processing. The Defendant officer departed the holding area while the Plaintiff remained in custody, creating uncertainty regarding the Plaintiff’s custodial status and ability to lawfully complete required procedures.

[3] The Defendant subsequently engaged in irregular administrative movement of the Plaintiff within the facility, including actions taken during prisoner transport to a provincial correctional facility. These actions disrupted standard custodial and roleplay procedures, broke custodial continuity, and directly resulted in administrative penalties imposed on the Plaintiff. Video evidence has been preserved and submitted in support of these facts.

[4] The events occurred at an RCMP detachment holding cell and during subsequent prisoner transport to a provincial correctional facility.

[5] A Notice of Civil Claim was properly filed and served upon the Defendant. The Notice clearly stated that the Defendant was required to file a Reply within 48 hours of being prompted by the Court.

[6] The Defendant failed to file a Reply within the required 48-hour period. The Defendant did not request an extension of time and did not otherwise respond.

**FINDINGS**

[7] Rather than proceeding on a motion for default, the Court finds the Defendant in default due to non-response.

[8] The Court is satisfied that the Defendant was duly served and failed to comply with procedural requirements. The Defendant therefore stands in default.

[9] Based on the uncontested evidence submitted by the Plaintiff, the Court accepts that the Defendant’s conduct constituted improper agency action and procedural misconduct resulting in harm to the Plaintiff.

**JUDGEMENTS AND ORDERS**

[10] Judgment is entered in favour of the Plaintiff due to the Defendant’s default.

[11] The Plaintiff is awarded 125,000 CAD in compensatory damages.

[12] The Defendant is ordered to comply with all custodial and procedural standards going forward.

[13] The Defendant must provide proof of full payment to the Court within seven (7) days of this order.

[14] Failure to comply with this order within seven (7) days shall result in the issuance of a warrant without further notice.

[15] Judgment is entered in favour of the Plaintiff as follows:
125,000 CAD for Improper Agency Action and Procedural Misconduct
Total: 125,000 CAD
