**INTRODUCTION**

[1] Cheif15092009 submitted an immediate resignation notice to the British Columbia Sheriffs
Service.

[2] On the 4th of August, 2024, 10:29 PM, Eastern Standard Time, Deputy Chief Sheriff,
AhoySimply, issued a blacklist to the former superintendent for violating department policy.

[3] On the 4th of August, 2024, (Time Unspecified), AhoySimply had submitted an application for
a warrant to the courts.

**FINDINGS**

[4] The superintendent did not provide proper notice to the Department per Department Policy,
however, this is not grounds for criminal action, instead civil action.

[5] Desertion is defined as: “Every person commits desertion when he is absent without leave
and he intends to remain permanently absent without leave or he intends to avoid a period of
active service. In this section, “active service” means service in the Canadian Armed Forces.”

[6] Cheif15092009 is a member of the Canadian Armed Forces, however, their resignation
towards the British Columbia Sheriffs Service does not reflect their occupation within the
Canadian Armed Forces.

[7] Tendering an Immediate Resignation in a department, that is not the Canadian Armed
Forces, is not grounds for criminal action.

**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is denied.
