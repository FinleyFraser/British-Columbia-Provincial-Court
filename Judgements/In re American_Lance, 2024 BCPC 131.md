**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On December 16th, 2024 the Honourable Provincial Judge HmmmMilton issued a warrant for the arrest of American_Lance for [First-Degree Murder](https://trello.com/c/JzuNh1ux/51-first-degree-murder) after an application for arrest warrant was made by Pxrplepxintz in [In re Pxrplepxintz, 2024 BCPC 126](https://github.com/FinleyFraser/British-Columbia-Provincial-Court/blob/main/Judgements/In%20re%20Pxrplepxintz%2C%202024%20BCPC%20126.md). 

[2] In the application for the arrest warrant the only useful evidence that was admitted was a [video](https://medal.tv/games/roblox/clips/jcrBd1N9A0YSRwiFd/9kuln8DtZ6No?invite=cr-MSxrREosNTg2NzIwOTIs) that showed Sergeant American_Lance exiting their vehicle and shooting the civilian. 

[3] The civilian who was killed was [armed with a P226](https://gyazo.com/60891aa55181dfd0ac5db19cfe03f6b0), a Schedule E non-restricted firearm. The civilian unlawfully owned and possessed this weapon as he was not licensed to possess or own it.

**ORIGINAL ARREST WARRANT CASE**

[4] The video does not show what happened before the video. Therefore it is unknown to the court that issued the arrest warrant whether or not the weapon was used against the officer. 

[5] The warrant was issued under false pretense and used an affidavit that contained factually incorrect information. The affidavit provided to the court stated that the civilian killed was unarmed, this, however, was proven to be untrue. 

[6] While affidavits are not required for warrants under the Constitution Act of 2024 the affidavit was used by the original court in their gaining of probable cause and issuance of the warrant. 

**DELIBERATE; NOT PLANNED**

[7] The arrest warrant was issued for First-Degree Murder (see para. 1). First-Degree Murder requires that the murder be planned and deliberate. 

[8] There was no evidence provided to the court that showed that the crime was planned in advance. It is not possible to infer that the crime was planned due to the lack of context.

[9] The officer “parking” his car in the path of the civilian does not show that a plan was developed to commit the murder, along with this it is clear to this court the officer's car was [stuck](https://gyazo.com/5e6e88a82592e055e8137d7c197ec11e) not parked or “staged”. 

[10] The murder was in fact deliberate as the officer meant to kill the civilian he did kill. 

**ADDITIONAL**

[11] A fundamental misunderstanding of how arrest warrants work in Vancouver was exhibited during this case. Arrest warrants are orders to arrest an individual in Vancouver, the individual does not face trial for their charges and they do not get a chance to defend themselves after the fact. 

**JUDGEMENT**

[12] In the Matter of the Application for the Arrest Warrant to be overturned, the application is **granted** and the Arrest Warrant is **overturned**.

[13] The [Arrest Warrant for American_Lance](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VRqR3eNDaITTnypyfGNo1p7iFz2K-f-o/view) is overturned and no longer to be enforced. The enforcement or execution of this arrest warrant will result in a charge of [Disobeying Order of Court](https://trello.com/c/odIpMyu3/26-disobeying-order-of-court) and may also come with civil penalties.
