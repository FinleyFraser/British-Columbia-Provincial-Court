**INTRODUCTION**

[1] Whereas, on or about an indisclosed date within discord, PxrplePxintz, the accused, allegedly harassing the petitioner, a law enforcement officer for the British Columbia Province of Canada.

[2] During this exchange, numerous things that the accused said imposed assumed fear upon the petitioner, such as "you are f*****" and "I'll f*** ur a** so hard" and "wait till I get in game u b**** a** white a** snow mf"

[3] All of these harmful sentences towards the petitioner were filed as a warrant against the accused for Criminal Harassement.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Criminal Harassement is defined as any person who "without lawful authority, causes another person to reasonable and in the whole of the circumstances, fear for their safety or the safety of anyone known to them" (Offences By-Law 88).

[5] It's evident to the eye that these words could make someone feel unsafe to even step foot within the City of Vancouver, but this court must take into account how much real fear is being imposed.

[6] Simply by someone stating that they'll "f*** ur a**" is more assumed fear than actual fear. This wasn't an act in game, but over discord. The actions over discord doesn't equate to the physical action one could do within roblox.

[7] It's unknown to the court if the actions on discord transpired to actions being committed on ROBLOX. 

[8] It's my job as the presiding judge in this case to see if the words said here, raised someone's fear on a level that a reasonable person would in accordance with probable casue.

[9] With [8] in mind, this court can conclude that the language spoken here didn't actually translate to a real action in game. This court will not set out of a warrant purely for getting into an arguement on discord.

**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is denied.
