**INTRODUCTION**

[1] Whereas, the applicant to applying to get the accused, re09533, arrested via warrant for Pointing a Firearm, Careless Use of a Firearm, Possession of a weapon for dangerous purpose, recklessly discharging a firearm, illegal discharge, brandishing a firearm, and obstruction of justice

[2] Upon a video caught by a CSIS officer, the accused pointed a gun at the ground and shot, in close proximity of others. The accused also yelled CSIS, running towards the CSIS officer, blowing their cover.

[3] Finally after [2], the CSIS officer took a video of the accused's plate after the accused hopped out of the conveyance, matching the avatar of the player. On the baasis of probable cause, this meets POID.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Persuant to the Offences By-law. The accused "without lawful excuse, intentionally, and for a sustained period of time, points a firearm" (Section 40). It's evident within the evidence that the accused physically pointed a firearm at the ground. Meeting "Pointing a Firearm"

[5] Pursuant to the Offences By-law. "without lawful excuse, ... handles ... a firearm ... without exercising due regard for the safety of other persons that would be expected of a reasonable person" (Section 39). It's evident here that someone that points a firearm at the ground near people could've caused injury to those around them. Due to this random firing in proximity of others that shouldn't of happened from the eyes of the reasonable person, this is met for "Careless Use of a Firearm"

[6] Pursuant to the Offences By-law. In this case, the Accused "carries... a weapon ... for a purpose dangerous to the public peace" (Section 41). Evident condsidering how this was within the proximity of others. This could've resulted in harm and therefore is dangerous to the public peace. This meets "Possession of weapon for dangerous purpose"

[7] Illegal Discharge is not a recognized crime within the Province of British Columbia and that charge was denied.

[8] Obstruction of Justice is not applicable here and is replaced with Obstruction of a peace officer due to the Accused "wilfully obstruct[ing] a peace officer in the execution of his or her duty" (Section 57). Just so happens that when the Accused yelled "CSIS," it blew the cover of the CSIS agent which obstructed the execution of CSIS' duty of securing national security intelligence for Canada.


**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is granted.
