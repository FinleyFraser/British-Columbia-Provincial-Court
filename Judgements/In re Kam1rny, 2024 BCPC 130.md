**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On an unknown date, the applicant, Kam1rny recieved a phone call form a phi126 asking for an alleged hit

[2] This alleged hit was "250 k for kill votto." This was said by phil126

[3] The call was out of the blue, this call was random. This call went from a question mark being sent to the request to a denial from the applicant. The call then ended.

**FINDINGS**

[4] It was established through questioning the petitioner (on the record), that the warrant is to be about bribery and conspiracy for murder.

[5] According to the offenses bylaws, section 85 states "Every person commits conspiracy to murder who conspires with any one to commit murder or to cause another person to be murdered."

[6] By examining this charge, I'm unable to determine what conspiracy even is which means case law was used. 

[7] Upon reading R. v. J.F., 2013 SCC 12 (CanLII), [2013] 1 SCR 565, it was established that "A person becomes party to an offence if he aids or abets a principal in the commission of the offence.  It follows that party liability to a conspiracy is made out where the accused aids or abets the actus reus of conspiracy, namely the conspirators’ act of agreeing."

[8] For me grant this warrant, it would also be saying that the officer/applicant of the warrant is also under the probable cause burden of proof for this charge. Upon looking at the evidence, we can see that the officer denied the request to murder.

[9] By denying the request to get "250 k," it doesn't follow with the standard that the supreme court of canada set when looking at "the conspirators’ act of agreeing."

[10] Due to there being no agreeance, therefore no conspiracy, I lack probable cause on the matter as no crime is being committed. By also granting this warrant, I'd be setting the expectation that by a random person saying that they'll do a crime, it's an automatic offense.

[11] There was also a lack of context to the phone call. In the statement of facts, this is ignored when confronted about "calling people including police officers to put a hit out on another cop."

[12] There's also no bribery taking place due to the lack of an offense being bribed about as the primary charge of conspiracy to murder being found to be void.



**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is denied.
