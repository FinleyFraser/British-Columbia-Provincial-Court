**INTRODUCTION**

[1] 2 people were protesting in front of the Vancouver Police Department.  This occured on Monday December 16th, 2024, at 4:15 AM

[2] Accross the street, the accused was standing on a bench. This happened on Monday December 16th, 2024, at 4:11 AM

[3] The accused, at the Vancouver Police Department was sitting in a chair making seemingly false accusations towards Law Enforcement. In which the applicant requests the charge of public mischief and corruption.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Through looking at the person on the bench and the person sitting near by the Vancouver Police Station, this court finds it hard to make proof of identification.

[5] To grant this application, the burden of proof of probable cause is needed. With probable cause, I must establish a sufficient POID. 

[6] Through looking at the evidence presented to me, I'm uanble to connect the username of the accused to the person within the evidence.

[7] Due to me being unable to find a username that connects to a person, I lack sufficient POID and therefore cannot find probable cause in the matter.

[8] Additionally, on the grounds of corruption, there's no bribery taking place or evidence sufficient to meet the standards for the charge of corruption.

**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is denied.
