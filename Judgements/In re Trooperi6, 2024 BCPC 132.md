**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On or about Monday the 16th, the applicant/officer for this matter was patrolling,

[2] During the patrol, the officer was stopped by the accused who has the username of "Aurorian_Eclipse." The Accused asked the applicant for their badge number repeatedly interfereing with the officer's duties.

[3] The Officer also reports the Accused going around and calling him repeatedly, interfereing with his duties.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Under examination, the applicant has requested the charges of Criminal Harassement and Disorderly Conduct.

[5] With that, the court lacks probable cause with criminal harassment on grounds of a lack of a crime being committed. By calling someone repeatedly or asking for a badge number, this action isn't inciting the officer to feel harm for their safety or people around them. (As defined by the definition of Criminal Harassment in the offenses bylaw)

[6] Also, with Disorderly Conduct, I lack probable cause due to a lack of a crime being committed. Sure by calling someone a lot is a form of normal harassment, this isn't severe disorderly conduct. As the accused must act "in such a way that he or she knows or ought to know is likely to offend against public decency or order."

[7] With the above quote in mind from Section 72 of the offences bylaw, by simply calling someone doesn't entail the caller to realize that this is entirely offending the public decency and order of the public. Sure it's slightly offensive, but is it harming the public order, NO. 

[8] With the fact of repeatedly asking for one's badge number, this isn't damaging the public in any form except asking the officer for their badge number. It's the officer's job to give out their badge number.

[9] Due to the constantly asking for a badge number and calling the officer, this isn't damaging the overall public order. Due to this, the court lacks probable cause on grounds of no crime being committed.




**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is denied.
