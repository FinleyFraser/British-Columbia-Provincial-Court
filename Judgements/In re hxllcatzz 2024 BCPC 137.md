**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On or about Monday the 17th, a pursuit was enganged. The petitioner was following the vehicle when the accused decided to ram the vehicle they were pursuing.

[2] In doing so, the accused pits the vehicle. The vehicle then drives off resulting in a person getting out.

[3] That person opened fired and was shot and tased and cuffed.

[4] As the petitioner is walking back to his car, the accused shoots the petitioner in the back.

**FINDINGS**

[4] The accused has committed the crimes of Discharging a Firearm With Intent to Wound and Recklessly Discharging a Firearm on the basis of probable cause.

[5] Under closer examination and discord communication, it's learned that the accused shot at the petitioner by taking a photo that only the accused could have taken. This wasn't clipped from the video as the photo and the clip never see to match

[6] Due to the POID being established, it was discovered that the accused decided to shoot by wanting to get the petitioner's attention. In doing so, that caused harm to the petitioner via shooting.

[7] This reckless act of using a firearm to simply get someone's attention is completely reckless. Under no circumstance should an officer recklessly use their firearm. No deadly force was shown to provoke the accused into shooting the petitioner

[8] Now, with Discharging with intent to wound, by the accused shooting at the petitioner, the accused must have intent to shoot. By having intent to shoot, it can be said that one had intent to harm. To quote exactly, Section 86 of the offences bylaws state "intent to wound, maim or disfigure, to endanger the life of."

[9] Here, the accused used their firearm to cause harm in which to cause the petitioner to have attention towards the accused. In doing so, this violated Section 86 of the offences bylaw as it resulted in the intent to disfigure and maim to get the attention of the petitioner.

[10] I wish to remind that probable cause is off of the basis that a reasonable person would say that a crime has been committed.




**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for an Warrant, the application is granted.
