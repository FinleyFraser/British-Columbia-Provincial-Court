**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On February 7th, 2025 Citizen of the Province of British Columbia iiCryptic_LawMD filed a mandamus application requesting the Premier of the Province of British Columbia be ordered by the court to comply with the [Legislative Styles and Titles Act (P.R. 5)](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h58tMaVOmCIW8ksWNuSiFNL-hOVRChYcJ8FZRd_10yE/edit?tab=t.0) (the "Act")

[2] The Act summarily requires that the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia name their acts within specific guidelines as for easy comprehension. Furthermore, it requires the Premier of the Province of British Columbia to create and maintain a codification of passed Acts by the Legislative Assembly.

**FACTS OF THE CASE**

[3] At the time of the application being filed, there was no codification of Acts passed by the Legislative Assembly. As of February 11th, 2025, the Speaker posted an updated [Revised Statutes of British Columbia](https://trello.com/b/Mg2BoaH0/revised-statutes-of-british-columbia) (the "Trello")

[4] There are two users who are "added" or "on" the Trello, the Speaker TiedFate (Trello name "ironicallyirish") and oversight member cv_r (abel) (Trello name "abelicious") 

[5] The Premier of British Columbia MikeOutlaws does not only not own the Trello board but he is not even a member of it.

**DOES THE PREMIER NEED TO OWN THE TRELLO BOARD**

[6] The current most important question of this case is whether or not the Premier needs to own the Trello board. Section 9 of the Act states "It is consequently the duty of the Premier, with the assistance of the Speaker of the Assembly and the Attorney General, to safekeep and maintain the Revised Statutes. [...]"

[7] Therefore it is implied that the Premier must own the Trello board as it is their duty to safekeep and maintain it, the Premier is unable to safekeep something they do not own or have access to.

**JUDGEMENT**

[8] It is in the opinion of this court that the Government is in violation of the Act and need be required to comply.

[9] As such the following orders are made:
- Speaker TiedFate is required to:
Add the Premier of British Columbia, MikeOutlaws, to the Trello and give him ownership by February 20th, 2025 at 23:00 Eastern Time.
- Premier MikeOutlaws is required to:
Update, maintain, and safekeep the Trello and work with the Speaker to gain ownership as required by the above.

Failure to comply with the above orders will result in penalty of Disobeying a Court Order.

It is so ordered,
