**INTRODUCTION**

[1] Accused, Archidanvxi was at a traffic stop when the officer asked for a hunting license.

[2] The accused never went into the trunk according to the evidence and shot the officer with a sidearm.

[3] Now comes, petitioner jessica127392 for a search warrant of the vehicle the accused used to search for illegal weapons.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Within your affidavit, you specify how in the beginning of the video we see him talking about his trunk. Turns out, within the evidence the officer asks to see a hunting license which is apprently in the trunk. Only reason why an officer would ask this is if there's firearm present. 

[5] The evidence also doesn't show him taking a firearm out of the trunk of the vehicle. The evidence simply shows the accused shooting an officer and stating that there's a hunting license in the trunk. 

[6] I deem there's no probable cause on grounds this is simply close to a reasonable suspicion or a hunch. I cannot grant a search warrant on a vehicle that the reasonable person would not be able to find a firearm there. Simply looking at the evidence, it appears the accused shot an officer, never went into the trunk. Simply the accused stating he has a hunting license in his trunk doesn't conclude that a weapon will be found there.



**JUDGEMENT**

In the Matter of an Applicant for a Search Warrant, the application is denied.
