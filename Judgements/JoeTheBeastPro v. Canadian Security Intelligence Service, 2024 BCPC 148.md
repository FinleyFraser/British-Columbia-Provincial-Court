**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On December 13th, 2024, at or around 14:43 (timezone unknown) the at the time Lieutenant Governor Palmurst informed the Plaintiff, JoeTheBeastPro, he was placed on administrative leave pending further investigation. 

[2] The Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) took point on this investigation, releasing a [press release](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RNt7NNzP_gVCOlYPYCe_MWp9KFmRIO0-/view) on December 21st, 2024. 

[3] On December 27th, 2024 JoeTheBeastPro filed a lawsuit against CSIS for "Negligence, Defamatory Libel or Slander, & Misrepresentation of Official Authority" (Misrepresentation of Official Authority was later dropped by the court due to a lack of legal basis).

[4] On February 17th, 2025, the Attorney General representing CSIS filed a Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice.](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fsYwvxXu8a8jHpbMXOf4xdJ73VI0EW5-MF80HXCEEwM/edit?tab=t.0).

[5] JoeTheBeastPro failed to admit any evidence of damages sustained as a result of the press release, only claiming the press release led to his termination from the Vancouver Police Department.

[6] Without admitted proof, it is impossible to prove damages to the plaintiff. For the defendant to be liable on any tort, they must have committed a tort violation and caused damage to the plaintiff. Without provable damages there is no provable liability. 

**CONCLUSION**

[7] As such, it is not possible to hold the Canadian Security Intelligence Service liable, therefore, there is no legal basis for this case to continue.

**COURT ORDER**

[8] Due to the above, the Motion to Dismiss w/ Prejudice is **GRANTED** and the **CASE** as a whole is dismissed **WITH PREJUDICE**.
