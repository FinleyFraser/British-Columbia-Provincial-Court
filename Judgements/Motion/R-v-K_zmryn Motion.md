**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This matter concerns a Defence Motion to Strike Crown Exhibits A through H.

[2] The Defence argues that the exhibits lack Proof of Identification, lack authenticity, and contain hearsay. The Defence submits the evidence should be excluded in full.

[3] The Crown opposes the motion and states that Proof of Identification has been or will be established through witness testimony. The Crown further argues that the Defence’s concerns go to weight, not admissibility.

[4] The exhibits consist primarily of screenshots of discord communications and roleplay interactions allegedly connected to the Accused.

**ISSUES**

[5] The Court must determine:

(a) Whether the exhibits should be struck for lack of Proof of Identification;

(b) Whether the screenshots are inadmissible hearsay; and

(c) Whether authenticity must be fully proven at this stage.

**LAW**

[6] Hearsay is generally inadmissible unless it meets an exception. In R v Khelawon, the Supreme Court of Canada confirmed that hearsay may be admitted where reliability and necessity are established.

[7] However, statements made by an accused person, if proven, are admissions and are not hearsay.

[8] Digital evidence must be shown to be what it claims to be. The threshold for authenticity at the admission stage is not high. The party offering the evidence must provide some basis to connect it to the person alleged.

**ANALYSIS**

[9] The Defence argues that the screenshots do not themselves prove that the accounts belong to the Accused. The Defence submits that without Proof of Identification, authenticity fails.

[10] The Court agrees that Proof of Identification is part of authenticity. Digital messages cannot be relied upon unless there is a reasonable basis to link them to the Accused.

[11] However, authenticity does not need to be proven entirely within the four corners of a screenshot. It may be established through witness testimony or other connecting evidence when the exhibit is introduced at trial.

[12] The Crown has stated that witnesses will testify regarding account ownership and the connection between the communications and the Accused. If the Crown fails to establish that connection at trial, the Defence may renew its objection.

[13] With respect to hearsay, statements authored by the Accused, if proven, are admissions and not hearsay. Statements made by third parties may raise hearsay concerns if they are offered to prove the truth of what was said. Those determinations are best made when each exhibit is tendered in context.
  
[14] The Defence also argues that the exhibits do not prove the actus reus of the offence. That argument relates to the strength of the evidence and ultimate guilt, not whether the exhibits may be considered at trial.

**FINDINGS**

[15] The Court finds that the Defence has raised legitimate concerns regarding Proof of Identification and authenticity.

[16] However, the Court is not satisfied that striking all exhibits at this stage is appropriate.

[17] The proper course is to require the Crown to lay sufficient foundation for authenticity and Proof of Identification when each exhibit is formally introduced.

**ORDER**
[18] The Defence Motion to Strike Crown Exhibits A through H is denied at this time.

[19] The Crown must establish Proof of Identification and authenticity before each exhibit is admitted at trial.

[20] The Defence may renew objections regarding hearsay or authenticity if the Crown fails to meet the required threshold.

[21] The matter shall proceed in accordance with this ruling.
