**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On June 9th, 2024 at 2:27 AM (Time unspecified), Amer1canValor of the Ambulance Service (Chief Ambulance Officer) blacklisted Pradacakessss for the use of Artificial Intelligence on an application to the British Columbia Ambulance Service.

[2] The Defendant in this matter has responded by filing a motion to dismiss as a response to the Petitioner's Notice of Claim filed in this matter. The motion of which this judgement concerns itself in.

**STANDARD OF REVIEW**

[3] In order to grant a motion to dismiss, the movant must prove that, in assuming the facts of the Notice of Claim as true, legal sufficiency for the torts alleged, or at least part of the torts alleged, does not exist.

**FINDINGS**

[4] The Defendant's motion to dismiss only brings up two (2) issues before this Court. The issues are as such: 1) The Petitioner's Notice of Claim is improperly filed, and 2) the Petitioner-Respondent (Respondent of motion) is not an employee of the Ambulance Service, and therefore not subject to the protections afforded by the Revised Employee Rights Bylaw. For the purposes of this ruling, the Court will resolve both issues.

[5] As to the first issue, this Court has previously held in *JumboBlueLaws11158z v. KeithDevAdmin*, 2023 MCR 111, *at* para. 3, that a small issue, in this case, a claim being improperly filed, or in the case of the *Keith* decision, a wrong tort being filed, are not justiciable under a motion to dismiss **WITH** prejudice, but are rather justiciable under a motion to dismiss **WITHOUT** prejudice. Therefore, this issue is not of priority to resolve by this Court here.

[6] As to the second issue, the legislation this Court will use for its determination is the *Revised Employee Rights Bylaw*, C.B. 28. In the Petitioner-Respondent's Response, the unprotected claim is countered by the citation of the definition of disciplinary action. But this Court views the Petitioner-Respondent's view, as far as the response filed goes, as a misinterpretation of the Revised Employee Rights Bylaw. 

[7] Section I(a)(i) of the *Revised Employee Rights Bylaw*, C.B. 28, reads "“employee” shall be defined as any resident employed within a lawfully established government agency but shall not include any resident employed with a designation of still being in training before entering full employment." Both parties agree that the Petitioner was blacklisted at the application phase, making the Petitioner a prospective employee, not a *de jure* employee as the Bylaw describes. The framers of the Bylaw wanted to protect employees, not prospective employees nor individuals with a training designation.

[8] Therefore, with the reasoning of Para. 7, the Petitioner's response wholly misapplies the Bylaw. Judgement is as follows.


**JUDGEMENT**

[9] It is therefore **ORDERED** and **ADJUDGED** that on the Eleventh Day of the Seventh month of Twenty Twenty-four that the Motion to Dismiss with Prejudice is **GRANTED**.
