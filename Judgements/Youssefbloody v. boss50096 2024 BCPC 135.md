**INTRODUCTION**

[1] Just read the NOC found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MtDPnDgJ4heDzp4rWI7DnR0xSL5vc0Hx/view

**CONCLUSION**

[2] Essentially, the only evidence the Plaintiff had were 3 witnesses. Through objections to discovery, the remaining witnesses dwindled down.

[3] Upon the trial, the Plaintiff's counselor failed to give an opening statement. The Defense counselor also failed to motion for a directed verdict.

[4] Upon my authority to get this case moving, I decided to sua sponte the decision to direct the verdict. 

[5] Upon looking at the evidence and finding only names of witnesses, I have no physical evidence or sworn words that the Plaintiff's party has.

[6] In total, due to the sheer lack of evidence that I can even work with (I was only given names...). I find the Defendant **not liable** of False Imprisonment, Negligence, and Slander

**COURT ORDER**

[7] No remedies are given out. No injunction orders are given out. No preliminary injunctions were given out.
