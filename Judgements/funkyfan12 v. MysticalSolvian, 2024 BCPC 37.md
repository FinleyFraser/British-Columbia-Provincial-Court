**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On the 5th of August, (Time Unspecified), funkyfan12 was detained by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at the Snacee’s Gas Station located on Cadero Street. [2] Funkyfan12 was issued a citation for “Obstructing Emergency Services” and then released from custody by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. [3] Shortly after, on the 6th of August, (time unspecified), the plaintiff, funkyfan12 submitted a civil case against the RCMP Superintendent on the claim of False Citation. [5] The defendant submitted a reply to the Notice of Claim filed by the defendant who decided to self-represent. [6] The plaintiff requests CAD 10K and requests for the record to be sealed by the court if the defendant is found liable.

**FINDINGS**

[7] The court determines that the plaintiff was present at a  Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services scene and was seen near a Royal Canadian Mounted Police Barrier. 

[8] Exhibit B, submitted by the plaintiff, shows that the plaintiff was sitting below and behind the barrier placed by the RCMP. The plaintiff was then instructed to get off the barrier, however, the plaintiff was not on the barrier at that time. After this altercation, the defendant had gone up to the RCMP Superintendent to ask for a supervisor and climbed onto the barrier while doing so. The plaintiff never crossed the barrier. During this altercation, the plaintiff is seen stating to the Superintendent “I'll punch you” “as self-defense”. The Superintendent is then seen detaining the plaintiff and placing them in the squad vehicle and issuing a citation for Obstruction of Emergency Services, then releasing them.

[9] During questioning, witnesses provided the following testimonies:

[10] AhoySimply, a witness listed for both the plaintiff and defense was asked by the plaintiff: “Now, by me being on the barrier, did that cause the firemen to not be able to fight the fire?”. AhoySimply responded “The scene was at a gas station, the gas pumps are highly flammable making it unsafe for civilians to be around which you were at the time of the incident. I also have a recollection of you being told to move along. It does not directly impede our ability to fight fires however it puts you at risk.”

[11] CaptainKryptek, a defense witness and the Fire Chief was asked by the defense: “Since you were scene command, were you aware at any point if the individual took the attention away from the first responders on the scene?” CaptainKryptek responded: “From my POV I don't think they took the attention of first responders, since they were actively communicating in VC and fighting the fire.”

[12] AhoySimply and CaptainKryptek, as the Deputy Chief and Fire Chief of Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services, were established as scene commands. Both testified that the duties of the firefighters were not being impeded or obstructed.

[13] Obstruction of Emergency Services is defined as: “Every person commits obstruction of emergency services who knowingly obstructs or impedes a member of the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services or the British Columbia Ambulance Service in the execution of their duties.”.

[14] For the citation to be valid, the court must determine:
Did the plaintiff knowingly impede or obstruct VFRS and their members?
If so, in what manner did the plaintiff do so?

[15] This court finds that being present behind a barrier and being briefly on it does not constitute an impediment to the VFRS duties. Witness testimonies directly support this, which indicates that the plaintiff's actions did not obstruct or impede their duties and operations in a significant matter that would constitute a citation or arrest.

[16] In the plaintiff's closing statement, the following was said: “I had asked AhoySimply how I posed as a “threat” to the scene. He replied: "It makes my job harder having to pay attention to two things at once leaving more room for error.” We’re here to establish if I committed the offense “Obstruction of Emergency Services” Making a job harder because he has to pay attention to two things at once is why I pose a threat? A firefighter should be able to multitask..”

[17] This court agrees that the issue here is not whether the firefighters' job was made harder, but whether their actions had impeded and or obstructed their duties. The evidence suggests that the plaintiff did not.

[19] In the defendant's closing statement, the following was said: “As given in testimony by two separate individuals, the suspect was non-compliant and distracted the Emergency Responders on-scene which can lead to injury and/or death. As in Exhibit A, the suspect did NOT comply with the Peace Officer's orders. CaptainKryptek's status in the fire service is irrelevant, as he has different points of view from everyone else”.

[20] The court does not agree with the claim of “distraction” and shall not be considered. Exhibit B shows that the plaintiff followed orders. Simply viewing a scene from behind barriers does not obstruct VFRS whilst they are fighting a fire. While the plaintiff briefly climbed the barrier when asking for a supervisor, they ceased immediately and complied. 


[21] The court does not agree that Captain Krystal's testimony was irrelevant. As the Fire Chief who was present at the scene, his testimony confirms that the plaintiff did not obstruct the Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services.

[22] As a member of Vancouver Fire and Rescue Services, you are trained to handle stressful situations effectively. Therefore, the presence of a bystander near a barrier or on top of a barrier should not interfere with your duties.

[23] All testimony was taken into account and reviewed, however, the highlighted testimony in these findings are the main reasons for the judgement of this case and hence their mention. No testimony was unaccounted for unless stricken from the record.

[24] With para. 8,12, 13, 15, 17, in mind, the courts ruling is as follows in the matter

**JUDGEMENT AND ORDERS**

[25] On Claim 1, False Citation, I find the defendant, MysticalSolvian, liable.

[26] A person has the right to seek relief for damages under the claim of False Citation when the tortfeasor, a law enforcement officer, has issued a citation to the Plaintiff without a legally justifiable cause. 
In this case, the citation was given to the plaintiff without a legally justifiable cause.
	
[27] This court orders that the Defendant, MysticalSolvian, pay the plaintiff, funkyfan12, CAD 10K in restitution.

Under the Enforcement Bylaw of 2022, [28] This court orders that the falsely issued record shall be expunged in full.
