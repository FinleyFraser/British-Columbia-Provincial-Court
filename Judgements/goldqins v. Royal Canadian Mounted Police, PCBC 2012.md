**INTRODUCTION**

[1] The British Columbia Ministry of Justice on behalf of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police filed a motion to dismiss without prejudice before the court in the matter of _goldqins v. Royal Canadian Mounted Police._ Their grounds to justify the motion were as follows:
1. The case was filed when 4PVD was still the commissioner, which he is no longer. The change in leadership _may_ enact new policies and procedures that may impact the investigation's integrity, which could lead to the case's integrity within the court.
2. With the leadership change there is the possibility of new evidence that could be used in the matter. Again they mention new possible policies and procedures.
3. The defendant's right to a fair trial would be compromised if the case proceeds based on the procedures and decisions made by the previous administration.

The plaintiff's response and the defendant's further responses are deemed non-significant or of importance in the judgment of this motion.

**FINDING**

[2] Section II(c) of the _Revised Employee Rights Bylaw_ C.B. 28 reads "By a preponderance of the evidence, employers must prove that any employee disciplined violates the agencyâ€™s regulation and that such employee is involved in the violation in question."

[3] For an employee to violate the agency's regulation, the regulation must be in effect at the time of the accused violation. Any policy made cannot be retroactively applied as the policy was not standing at the time. Since an employer cannot retroactively enforce policies, any new policies the new commissioner may or may not have made are not relevant in the matter.  Along with the aforementioned reasoning any investigative changes are irrelevant as the action has already been taken against the plaintiff, including changes to the agency's internal affairs.

[4] With Para. 3 in mind the courts ruling is as follows in the matter.

**COURT ORDER**

[5] It is therefore **DECIDED** that on the Twentieth Day of the Seventh month of Twenty Twenty-four that the Motion to Dismiss without Prejudice is **DENIED**.
