**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This is an application for judicial review of a disciplinary decision made by the Law Society suspending the petitioner’s licence to practise law for a period of two weeks.

[2] The petitioner argues that the Law Society lacked legal authority to regulate lawyers or impose disciplinary sanctions. He submits that no valid legislative framework exists granting such authority, and that the suspension decision is therefore void.

[3] The respondent Attorney General submits that the Law Society operates under an established regulatory framework, possesses authority to govern the legal profession, and followed proper procedures in reaching its decision.

**ISSUES**

[4] The issues before the Court are:

1. Does the Law Society possess legal authority to regulate lawyers and impose disciplinary sanctions?
2. Was the suspension decision ultra vires or otherwise unlawful?
If not, is the decision unreasonable or procedurally unfair?

**STANDARD OF REVIEW**

[5] Whether the Law Society has legal authority is a question of law and is reviewed on a correctness standard.

[6] The exercise of that authority is reviewed on a reasonableness standard.

**ANALYSIS**

**Authority of the Law Society:**

[7] The petitioner is correct that administrative bodies do not have unlimited power and may only act within authority granted by law.

[8] However, Canadian administrative law recognizes that regulatory bodies may exercise implied authority where such authority is necessary to carry out their mandate.

[9] Law societies in British Columbia have long been responsible for licensing lawyers, setting professional standards, and enforcing discipline. This regulatory role is widely recognized by courts and government.

[10] The evidence before the Court establishes that the Law Society operates within an existing legislative and regulatory framework, including a Code of Professional Conduct. The petitioner has previously acknowledged and relied on this framework.

[11] The Court is satisfied that the Law Society has legal authority to regulate lawyers and impose disciplinary sanctions.

**Legislative Changes:**

[12] The petitioner argues that previous legislative changes removed the Law Society’s authority.

[13] The Court is not persuaded that any such changes clearly or expressly repealed the Law Society’s regulatory role. Authority is presumed to continue unless clearly removed.

[14] The continued operation and recognition of the Law Society support the conclusion that its authority remains in effect.

**Roncarelli v Duplessis:**

[15] The petitioner places significant emphasis on Roncarelli v Duplessis, [1959] SCR 121.

[16] That case establishes the principle that discretionary power cannot be used in an arbitrary, capricious, or improper way.

[17] However, Roncarelli does not suggest that a regulatory authority must fail unless every detail of its power is spelled out in exact statutory terms. The ruling is about preventing abuse of power, not about questioning professional regulation conducted within an established framework.

[18] In this case, there is nothing before the Court to suggest that the Law Society acted arbitrarily, in bad faith, or for any improper purpose.

**Reasonableness and Fairness:**

[19] The Court has reviewed the materials and record before it and is satisfied that the petitioner was informed of the findings, the disciplinary sanction imposed, and the consequences of that sanction.

[20] A two-week suspension falls within a reasonable range of outcomes available to the Law Society for the violations identified.

[21] Judicial review is not an appeal. The Court’s role is not to reweigh the evidence or substitute its own decision for that of the Law Society, but to ensure that the decision was made within legal authority and was reasonable.

**CONCLUSION**

[22] The Law Society had legal authority to regulate the petitioner and impose discipline.

[23] The suspension decision was lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair.

[24] The application for judicial review is dismissed.

**ORDER**

[25] The petition for judicial review is dismissed.  

[26] The disciplinary suspension imposed by the Law Society remains in effect.
