**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This is an application for judicial review of a disciplinary decision made by the Law Society suspending the petitioner’s licence to practise law for a period of two weeks.

[2] The petitioner argues that the Law Society lacked legal authority to regulate lawyers or impose disciplinary sanctions. He submits that no valid legislative framework exists granting such authority, and that the suspension decision is therefore void.

[3] The respondent Attorney General submits that the Law Society operates under an established regulatory framework, possesses authority to govern the legal profession, and followed proper procedures in reaching its decision.
**ISSUES**

[4] The issues before the Court are:

a. Does the Law Society have legal authority to regulate lawyers and impose discipline?  
b. If so, was the suspension decision unlawful or unreasonable?

**STANDARD OF REVIEW**

[5] Whether the Law Society has legal authority is a question of law and is reviewed on a correctness standard.

[6] The exercise of that authority is reviewed on a reasonableness standard.

**ANALYSIS**

Authority of the Law Society:

[7] The petitioner is correct that administrative bodies do not have unlimited power and may only act within authority granted by law.

[8] However, Canadian administrative law recognizes that regulatory bodies may exercise implied authority where such authority is necessary to carry out their mandate.

[9] Law societies in British Columbia have long been responsible for licensing lawyers, setting professional standards, and enforcing discipline. This regulatory role is widely recognized by courts and government.

[10] The evidence before the Court establishes that the Law Society operates within an existing legislative and regulatory framework, including a Code of Professional Conduct. The petitioner has previously acknowledged and relied on this framework.

[11] The Court is satisfied that the Law Society has legal authority to regulate lawyers and impose disciplinary sanctions.

Legislative Changes:

[16] The petitioner argues that previous legislative changes removed the Law Society’s authority.

[17] The Court is not persuaded that any such changes clearly or expressly repealed the Law Society’s regulatory role. Authority is presumed to continue unless clearly removed.

[18] The continued operation and recognition of the Law Society support the conclusion that its authority remains in effect.

Reasonableness and Fairness:

[19] The decision was made following deliberation and a recorded vote. The petitioner was informed of the findings, the sanction, and the consequences.

[20] A two-week suspension falls within a reasonable range of outcomes for the violations found.

[21] Judicial review is not an appeal. The Court does not reweigh the evidence or substitute its own decision for that of the Law Society.

**CONCLUSION**

[22] The Law Society had legal authority to regulate the petitioner and impose discipline.

[23] The suspension decision was lawful, reasonable, and procedurally fair.

[24] The application for judicial review is dismissed.

**ORDER**

[25] The petition for judicial review is dismissed.  

[26] The disciplinary suspension imposed by the Law Society remains in effect.  

[27] No order as to costs.
