**INTRODUCTION**

[1] This matter concerns a civil action brought by the Plaintiff, MrLoopaDoopa, against the Defendant, Re09533, alleging harassment and defamatory libel or slander

[2] The Plaintiff asserts that beginning on or about October 27, the Defendant repeatedly made public statements referring to the Plaintiff as a “terrorist.” The Plaintiff alleges that these statements were made approximately seven times, were entirely false, and were intended to damage the Plaintiff’s public image and credibility.

[3] A Notice of Civil Claim was properly filed and served upon the Defendant. The Defendant did not file a Response to Civil Claim within the required time period. The notice clearly stated:

“The defendant must complete and file a Reply within 48 hours from being prompted by the Court. If the defendant does not reply, a court order may be made against the defendant without further notice, and the defendant may be required to pay the amount claimed.”

[4] The Defendant did not file a Reply within the required 48-hour period.

[4] The Plaintiff subsequently filed an Application for Default Judgment, requesting that judgment be entered in his favour due to the Defendant’s failure to respond.

**FINDINGS**

[5] The Court is satisfied that the Defendant was duly served and failed to file a Response to Civil Claim within the  time limit. The Defendant therefore stands in default.

[7] The Defendant did not respond, did not request more time, and did not attempt to resolve the matter. As a result, the Defendant is in default.
 
[8] Based on the evidence submitted by the Plaintiff, the Court accepts that the Defendant made repeated false statements accusing the Plaintiff of being a “terrorist,” and that these statements were intended to damage the Plaintiff’s reputation. The Court also accepts that the conduct was ongoing and targeted, meeting the standard for harassment.

**JUDGEMENTS AND ORDERS**

[9] The Plaintiff’s Motion for Default Judgment is granted.

[10] Judgment is entered in favour of the Plaintiff as follows:
125,000 CAD for Harassment
125,000 CAD for Defamatory Libel or Slander
Total: 250,000 CAD

[11] The Defendant is ordered to cease and desist from making any further defamatory or harassing statements about the Plaintiff.

[12] The Defendant must provide proof of full payment to the Court within the same seven-day period.

[13] If the Defendant fails to pay in full within 7 days, a warrant will be issued.
