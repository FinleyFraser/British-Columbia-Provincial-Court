**INTRODUCTION**

[1] On the 10th, of November 2024, (Time Unspecified). The defendant, detained the plaintiff Smartboy1087 for talking about coke/co-cocla in-game.

[2] On 17th, of November 2024, the plaintiff initiated a civil case by filing and submitting a Notice of Claimn against the defendant, joethebeastpro.

[3] The plaintiff is suing the defendant for the following torts, Assault, Harassment, False Impriosnment, Infrifgment of Rights by Person, and Misrepresentation of Official Authority.

**FINDINGS**

[4] Officer Joe reasonably believed the term "coke" could refer to illegal drugs, but he failed to investigate further before initiating detainment. The complainant was discussing Coca-Cola, as evidenced in Exhibit D and corroborated by witness testimony.

[5] This lack of due diligence before taking action demonstrates negligence, particularly in light of the Supreme Court’s decision in Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police (2007 SCC 41), which establishes a standard of reasonable care in police investigations.

[6] Officer Joe detained the complainant without clearly articulating the basis for probable cause, as required under R. v. Mann (2004 SCC 52).

[7] The use of force, including handcuffing and the momentary drawing of a firearm, was excessive and breached the proportionality principle set out in R. v. Nasogaluak (2010 SCC 6).

[8] The complainant’s Charter rights under Sections 9 and 10 were violated due to arbitrary detention and the failure to provide reasons for detention.

[9] The complainant was detained and restrained without adequate justification, constituting false imprisonment and harassment as outlined in Collins v. The Queen (1987 SCC).

**JUDGEMENTS AND ORDERS**

[10] Officer Joe’s handling of the situation, including the momentary withdrawal of a firearm, failure to justify the detainment, and use of excessive force, represents a clear deviation from lawful and professional conduct. His actions demonstrated negligence, lack of proper judgment, and a misuse of his authority.

[11] Furthermore, the court finds the defendant liable on all counts, Assault, Harassment, False Impriosnment, Infrifgment of Rights by Person, and Misrepresentation of Official Authority.

[12] The court orders that the defendant pay the plaintiff a sum of 34,000 CAD by 01/30/2025.

[13] It is so ordered.
